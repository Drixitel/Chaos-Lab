# Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos 
- Data pulled from CSV files 
- Results located in Graphs folder
- Analysis found in .ipynb files 
# RCL
- used as a standard for comparison 
# Choas 
- At low input voltages it should behave like RCL 
- Period doubling occurs in higher inputs and a fundamenta constant is meausred 
- Data values are not very good however images do reflect doubling and chaos 
  - The reason for the poor data values was due to a misunderstanding on how to properly select data values 
- Choas was found with "the road to chaos via period doubling" 
- Visually the signal jumped and chnaged shape in a nonlinear way while the input value was unchanged
# Results 
- Choas circuit did behave like RCL at low input 
- The constant was meausred in a trial run but not in a rigerous way due to time constraints 
- A deeper understandind of diodes 
  - Capacitance 
  - Resistance 
- We also observed a full attenuation at 500kHz followed by the return of a steady signal 
  - This was unaccounted for but could serve as a future investigation
